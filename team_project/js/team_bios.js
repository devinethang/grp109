                Hi! My name is Wilber or you can call me Wil, and welcome to my mini page!
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm currently a student at Bellevue 
                College and pursuing a BAS in Software Develpoment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of my favorite hobbies include working out, eating, traveling to diffrent countries and of course, programming.
                I'm also a huge Marvel fan so from time to time, you'll find me re-watching a Marvel movie or show.
              </p>
              <p>
              For this project, I will serve as the team leader, responsible for designing, developing, and providing support across all aspects of the site's creation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Feel free to connect with me at anytime, and yes, I would love to collaborate!
