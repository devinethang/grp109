      <h1>About The Hive</h1>

      <h2>Project Goal</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of the group project was to practice various aspects of web
        development and design while working with a team.
      </p>

      <h2>Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        The Hive was born during a backpacking trip through the countryside of
        Japan, where we stumbled upon a family run apiary tucked between
        blooming cherry trees and mountain air. They shared honey harvested with
        age old methods and deep respect for the bees. The taste was
        unforgettable, but what truly stuck with us was the harmony between
        nature and tradition. Inspired, we returned home with a vision to bring
        that same purity, sustainability, and care to every jar of honey we
        produce. That vision became The Hive.
      </p>

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The Hive is a platform meant to englighten people about the greatness of
        honey, showcase our products, contact us, and be a hub for honey
        enthusiasts to try new types of honey.
      </p>
