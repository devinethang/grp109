        <h2>Team Goals & Outcomes</h2>

        <p class="met">
          Implement a responsive layout for all screen sizes - MET
        </p>
        <p>
          We made sure our layout adapted to desktop, tablet, and mobile using
          CSS Flexbox and media queries.
        </p>

        <p class="met">
          Use JavaScript for dynamic functionality (e.g., loading
          navigation/footer) - MET
        </p>
        <p>
          We successfully used JavaScript to dynamically load the nav and footer
          to avoid code duplication.
        </p>

        <p class="met">
          Ensure semantic HTML structure across all pages — MET (mostly)
        </p>
        <p>
          We used semantic tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,
          <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, though we
          had a few structure issues at first that were corrected later.
        </p>

        <p class="met">
          Write clean, well-organized CSS for maintainable styling — MET
        </p>
        <p>
          We kept our CSS organized by page and used consistent naming
          conventions for readability.
        </p>

        <p class="met">
          Have at least one “extra” feature (e.g., animations, product gallery,
          or form validation) — MET
        </p>
        <p>
          We added a working contact form with validation and an embedded
          narrated PowerPoint, which went beyond basic requirements.
        </p>

        <p class="met">
          Update the site over time to include more dynamic JavaScript features
          — MET
        </p>
        <p>
          We improved our project throughout the quarter by moving repeated
          elements (nav/footer) to JavaScript templates and adding client-side
          form validation. These steps made the site cleaner and more
          maintainable.
        </p>

        <p class="semi-met">
          Collaborate effectively as a team using GitHub — SEMI MET
        </p>
        <p>
          We used GitHub for hosting and updates, but didn’t fully utilize
          branches or pull requests. Some changes were committed directly to
          main, which sometimes caused merge conflicts.
